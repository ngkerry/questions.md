1. What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop? 
A for loop is a primary looping structure that repeats a segment of code a specific number of times, while the while loop repeats a segment of code an unknown number of times (continues to execute code over and over again). The code within a while loop will execute while the specified condition is true. 

2. What are the four parts of a for loop? What do they do? 

Variable declaration: initializes the variable at the beginning of the loop to some value. This value is the starting point of the loop. 

Condition: decides whether the loop will continue running to not. While this condition is true, the loop will continue running. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will stop running. 

Increment statement: the part of the loop that changes the value of the variable created in the variable declaration part of the loop. The increment statement is the part of the loop which will eventually stop the loop from running. 

3. What does "nested" mean in the context of nested loops? 
Nested means fully contained within something else of the same kind. Described code that performs a particular function and that is contained within code that performs a broader function.
